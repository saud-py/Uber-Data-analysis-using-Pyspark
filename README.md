# Uber Data Analysis with PySpark

This project aims to analyze a dataset from Uber using PySpark, a powerful Python library for big data processing. The primary goal is to gain insights into the demand and supply dynamics of the Uber industry by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical Uber trip records, including details such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, trip duration, and other relevant information. The dataset is stored in a CSV format.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- PySpark
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook (if using):

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the Uber_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook to begin the analysis.

Usage
Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open the Uber_Data_Analysis.ipynb file.

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:

Load and examine the Uber dataset.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing using PySpark.
Analyze demand and supply trends using various PySpark operations.
Visualize the results using PySpark SQL and Spark DataFrame APIs.
Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the analysis output.
